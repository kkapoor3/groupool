### GrouPool Project 
---
 - GrouPool is a mobile application that helps its users to find carpool groups for themselves. 
 - The app will suggest matches according to the usersâ€™ daily schedule and location.
 - After getting matches, the users can make a carpool group and use the group chat option provided in the mobile app. 
 - The app will also include features like a cost calculator and bill splitter. 

#### Current Features
---
 - PM and group chats for GrouPools
 - User search and lookup
 - Create new room
 - Add users to rooms

#### Planned Features
---
 - Route entry and user matching system to ensure efficient carpooling
 - Cost Calculator/Split feature where the users will be able to input data such as their fuel efficiency and cost of gas. The app will then calculate how to evenly split the cost of the ride between users such that they can split the cost per ride each time **or** rotate the driver/car accordingly in a way that it is fair to all members
